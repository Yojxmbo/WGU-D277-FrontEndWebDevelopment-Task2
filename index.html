            <p>
                    With a population surpassing 29 million, Texas stands 
                as the second-most populous state in the United States. 
                Officially incorporated into the Union on December 29, 1845, 
                Texas has a rich history and cultural diversity. The state 
                capital, Austin, is nestled in the central region of Texas, 
                surrounded by the scenic Hill Country. 
            </p>

                Texas defies easy classification, exhibiting a dynamic blend of
                urban, suburban, and rural landscapes that contribute to its 
                unique character. Boasting a robust economy, Texas often surpasses 
                the national average in terms of income levels, reflecting its 
                position as a major economic powerhouse within the United States.
